Applications, including telemedicine and remote patient monitoring, along with new emerging care models aim to place the patient at the centre of care, with emphasis on outcomes, patient experience, and the delivered value. This paper presents a user-centered design framework for integrating contactless vital signs measurement into clinical workflows. 

Since this technology is not yet widely deployed in standard clinical use, its use implies novel design challenges. The primary contribution is a participatory process for presenting acquired vital signs in an explainable and trustworthy way.
