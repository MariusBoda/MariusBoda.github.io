I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Aalto University, majoring in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence. Alongside my studies, I work as a Graduate Research Assistant focusing on Machine Learning and Nonlinear Dynamics.

**My research focuses on noise reduction limits in nonlinear dynamical systems.** Specifically, I develop mathematical formulations to estimate theoretical signal recovery bounds in stochastic environments. I also design system identification algorithms to forecast the behavior of coupled networks under heavy noise, establishing foundational methods for identifying signal limitations in non-linear control systems.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Quantum Technology, also from Aalto University. I bring applied industry experience in computer vision and image signal processing. I recently worked as a Systems Development Engineer Intern at Amazon, where I formulated a novel hierarchical spatiotemporal machine learning network to mitigate sensor noise and motion blur. Before that, I was a Computer Vision Intern at Oyla AI in California.
